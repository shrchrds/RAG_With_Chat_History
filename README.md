# RAG with Chat History

This project explores the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of chat history. RAG is a technique that combines retrieval and generation models to enhance the performance of conversational AI agents.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate how incorporating chat history can improve the performance of a RAG-based conversational system. By leveraging the information contained in previous conversations, the system may be able to provide more relevant and contextual responses.

## Features

- Utilizes the RAG model architecture to combine retrieval and generation components
- Incorporates chat history as an additional input to the model
- Explores the impact of chat history on the model's performance

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then open the `RAG_With_Chat_History.ipynb` file and run the code cells to experiment with the RAG model and chat history integration.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant AI/ML libraries
